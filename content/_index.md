I am a 6th year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill](http://cs.unc.edu/).
I'm advised by [Donald Porter](https://cs.unc.edu/~porter) who leads the [OSCAR lab](http://oscarlab.github.io).
I was previously at [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/index.php),
where I earned a Master's Degree.
While at Stony Brook, I had the privilege of also being advised by
[Rob Johnson](https://research.vmware.com/researchers/rob-johnson),
and [Michael Ferdman](http://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman/)
both of whom I still occasionally collaborate with.
More recently, I've been collaborating with [Chris Rossbach](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/)
at U.T. Austin and [VMware Research Group](https://research.vmware.com/),
on all things accelerators.

I work at the interface of System Software (OS, File Systems, Compilers), and Computer
Architecture (ISAs, accelerator interfaces, etc.). A considerable part of the first 2
years of my Ph.D. benchmarking the [BetrFS project](http://www.betrfs.org).

At the moment I'm:

* studying the [distribution of x86 instructions](http://x86instructionpop.com/) in all the C/C++ binaries from the Ubuntu repositories, in the hope of drawing interesting insights to help design a subset ISA,
* trying to get [first-class citizenship for programmable accelerators](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNnoErAb5h9FaRoKvfUgypjYvLwja5J9/view?usp=sharing),
* thinking about general solutions to the problem of [virtualizing specialized accelerators](https://research.vmware.com/projects/trillium),
* and in general having fun with system software for heterogeneous compute.

I followed my advisor to UNC when he moved to Chapel Hill in Fall 2016, from Stony Brook University where I spent 4 amazing years, both as an M.S., and a Ph.D. student. Before moving to the USA for graduate school, I lived in Bangalore, India for 9 years. Before that, I spent about 9 years in Singapore and Malaysia as a kid. I was born and lived in India for the first 5 years.

I've got a bad case of the travel bug. I enjoy some amount of outdoor activity, especially in calm, less-trafficked places. I used to be an avid gamer, and fantasy/science-fiction reader, although I've done very little of either in the recent past.

I am an [ordained](https://dudeism.com/ordcertificate-print.php?ordname=Amogh%20Akshintala&orddate=12/30/2018) [Dudeist priest](https://dudeism.com/).
