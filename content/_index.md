I am a 6th year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill](http://cs.unc.edu/).
I'm extremely fortunate to be advised by a number of amazing people:
[Don Porter](https://cs.unc.edu/~porter) (who leads the [OSCAR lab](http://oscarlab.github.io) at UNC), [Chris Rossbach](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) (at UT Austin and [VMware Research Group](https://research.vmware.com/)), and [Michael Ferdman](http://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of System Software (OS, File Systems, Compilers) and Computer Architecture (ISAs, accelerator interfaces, etc.).

At the moment I'm:

* studying the [distribution of x86 instructions](http://x86instructionpop.com/) in all the C/C++ binaries from the Ubuntu repositories, in the hope of drawing interesting insights to help design a subset ISA,
* trying to get [first-class citizenship for programmable accelerators](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNnoErAb5h9FaRoKvfUgypjYvLwja5J9/view?usp=sharing),
* thinking about general solutions to the problem of [virtualizing specialized accelerators](https://aakshintala.com/papers/ava-hotos19.pdf),
* and in general [having fun with heterogeneous compute](https://github.com/aakshintala/darknet).

I'm proud to have spent a considerable part of the first 2 years of my Ph.D. as the benchmark czar for the [BetrFS project](http://www.betrfs.org).

I'm involved in an effort to document and share the often-forgotten human-side of CS research: [CSRTales](https://medium.com/csr-tales).

I followed my advisor to UNC when he moved to Chapel Hill in Fall 2016, from Stony Brook University where I spent 4 amazing years, both as an M.S., and a Ph.D. student. Before moving to the USA for graduate school, I lived in Bangalore, India for 9 years. Before that, I spent about 9 years in Singapore and Malaysia as a kid. I was born and lived in India for the first 5 years.

I've got a bad case of the travel bug --- I'm on a plane almost every month. I enjoy some amount of outdoor activity, especially in calm, less-trafficked places. I used to be an avid gamer, and fantasy/science-fiction reader, although I've done very little of either in the recent past.

I am an [ordained](https://dudeism.com/ordcertificate-print.php?ordname=Amogh%20Akshintala&orddate=12/30/2018) [Dudeist priest](https://dudeism.com/).
