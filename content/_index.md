I am a 5th year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill](http://cs.unc.edu/). I'm advised by <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/~porter">Donald Porter</a> who leads the <a href="http://oscarlab.github.io/">OSCAR lab</a>.
While at Stony Brook, I had the privilege of also being advised by
<a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rob/">Rob Johnson</a>,
and <a href="http://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman/">Michael Ferdman</a> both of whom I still occasionally collaborate with.
More recently, I've been collaboraing with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/">Chris Rossbach</a> at U.T. Austin, and VMware Research Group, on all things accelerators.

I am broadly interested in System Software (OS, File Systems, Compilers), and Computer Architecture. I spent a considerable part of the first 2 years of my Ph.D. benchmarking and thinking about the <a href="http://www.betrfs.org">BetrFS project</a>. At the moment I'm:

* studying the [distribution of x86 instructions](http://x86instructionpop.com/) in all the C/C++ binaries from the Ubuntu repositories, in the hope of drawing interesting insights to help design a subset ISA,
* trying to get [first-class citizenship for programmable accelerators](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNnoErAb5h9FaRoKvfUgypjYvLwja5J9/view?usp=sharing),
* thinking about general solutions to the problem of [virtualizing specialized accelerators](https://research.vmware.com/projects/trillium),
* and in general having fun with system software for heterogeneous compute.

I followed my advisor to UNC when he moved to Chapel Hill in Fall 2016, from Stony Brook University where I spent 4 amazing years, both as an M.S., and a Ph.D. student. Before moving to the USA for graduate school, I lived in Bangalore, India for 9 years. Before that, I spent about 9 years in Singapore and Malaysia as a kid.

I've got a bad case of the travel bug. I enjoy some amount of outdoor activity, especially in calm, less-trafficked places. I used to be an avid gamer, and fantasy/science-fiction reader, although I've done very little of either in the recent past.
